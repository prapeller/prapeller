- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @prapeller
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding something interesting)).
- For now I only studying these matters, so no so big specialist yet. But as far as I understood from 1 being a little akquanted with IT sphere during 2021 year - I will study in this sphere forever)) And it makes it more interesting. I hope some day i will be part of some interesting IT project where I will be usefull.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying at Russian GeekBrains online university for Python developer.
Recently during studying I started working on my petproject called 'ChineseBreak', service that now is seen to me as some kind of web/mobile application that will allow people to study languages for free, in interactive form, from skratch.
I almost finished admin panel where administators of this service will be able to fill studying programs for lessons consisting of interactive tasks, to upload media for them etc...
The basic idea of this application was took from currently well being and great working mobile application called HelloChinese. I started to study Chinese a little last year, studied it at that HelloChinese application also, and understood that it would be great to create something similar myself.
So, everybody who will meet some common functionality in my future application and HelloChinese' application - dont worry, i dont hide that original application is HelloChinese))
That will be opensource project, not for money, free and for improving my understanding how to build some kind of these applications.
In these circumstances, that would be great if someone will split this interest with me. I would be very grad to explain details of that petproject.
