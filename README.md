ðŸŒ± CV:

Iâ€™m newcomer to world of IT)) took some courses on udemy / gb.ru / youtube and other sources from internet including documentation of course)) Almost all courses that I pass - I push them to my repos at GitHub here so it could be tracked like kind of summary for myself what I've learned already.

I was passionate about studying Chinese language 2 years ago, probably because my main partners in current occupation are from China. I did that studying using mobile application, and some day I wanted to try create something similar myself. I wanted to create application that will allow people to study languages for free, in interactive form, from scratch. For now I made admin panel using flask web micro framework. You can find repo of this admin panel here https://github.com/prapeller/chinesebreak  Now it has the only functuanality for admins to implement CRUD operations with lessons consisting of interactive tasks, to upload media for them etc. Now I want to make the same admin panel with Django framework, bcz recently studied some of that. That how I was interested in IT. 
I understood a little more about it now in comparison with 2020 when i started my interests in this sphere. But still theres so much to learn and thats encourage me a lot! All this was my hobby during last 1,5 year, bcz my main job was connected with logistics and international trading. What I want from IT now - development myself as professional in this sphere, considering it as main doing of life.

All the time I was interested in usefull servises that can help people to solve their problems and needs. IT - great tool for creating such servises.
