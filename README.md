- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @prapeller
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding and creating any automation systems. I only study this matter now, so no so big specialist for now. 
But its very interesting and hope some day i will be part of some big project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying at Russian GeekBrains online university for Python developer. 
Recently i started working on my petproject, service in form of web/mobile application that will allow people to study languages for free in interactive form from skratch.
I almost finished admin panel where administators of this service will be able to fill studying programs for different languages. 
The basic idea was took from currently well being and great working mobile application called HelloChinese. I started to study Chinese last year, studied a little at that application and understood that it would be great to create something similar myself.
So, everybody who will meet some common functionality in my future application and HelloChinese' application - dont worry, i dont hide that original application is HelloChinese))
That will be opensource project, not for money, free and for improving my understanding how to build some kind of these applications.
In these circumstances, that would be great if someone will split this interest with me. I would be very grad to explain details of that petproject.
