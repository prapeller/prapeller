ðŸŒ± CV:

Iâ€™m currently passing courses at https://gb.ru/ where have finished basics of Python, SQL, Git, Ubuntu, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Django, Djangorestframework starts soon. Also I take from Udemy, YouTube and other sources from internet including documentation of course)) Almost all courses that I pass - I push them to my repos at GitHub here so it could be tracked like summary what I've learned already.

I was passionate about studying Chinese language 2 years ago, probably because my main partners in current occupation are from China. I did that using mobile application, and some day I wanted to try create something similar myself. I wanted to create application that will allow people to study languages for free, in interactive form, from scratch. For now I made admin panel using flask web micro framework. You can find repo of this admin panel here https://github.com/prapeller/chinesebreak.com. Now it has the only functuanality for admins to implement CRUD operations with lessons consisting of interactive tasks, to upload media for them etc. Now I want to make the same admin panel with Django framework, bcz recently studied some of that. Maybe someday that will be some kind of pet-project)) That how I was interested in IT. 

I understood a little more about it now in comparison with 2020 when i started interests in this sphere. But still theres so much to learn and thats encourage me a lot! All this was my hobby during last 1,5 year, bcz my main job was connected with logistics and international trading. What I want from IT now - development myself as professional in this sphere, considering it as main doing of life.

All the time I was interested in usefull servises that can help people to solve their problems and needs. IT - great tool for creating such servises.
For now I only studying these matters, so not huge specialist yet. But as far as I understood from being a little acquainted with studying IT during 2021 year - I will study it forever. Because it's universe is infinite and its spreading with time. And this fact makes the whole process more interesting. I hope some day I will be useful part of some interesting product or service.
